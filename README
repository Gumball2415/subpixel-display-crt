===============================

This project is modified specifically for TV CRT displaying NES/FC screens,
but can be easily modified for other inputs. This project was primarily
designed to be rendered in Cycles, though preview in Eevee is possible.

Included here are two different shadowmasks (inline and trinitron),two
scanline fields, some example screenshots of PinoBatch's 240p Test Suite
from Mesen using blargg's NTSC filter, and example renders at 1920x1080p.

The original description is preserved below for reading.

This scene shows three simple PC-CRT, LCD and TV-CRT subpixel setups.
The default workspace has cameras set up - try rendering them individually.

The TV-CRT example clearly has problems with every second pixel column
being shifted half a row - for this, the source image has to be shifted
accordingly.
