===============================

This project is modified specifically for TV CRT displaying NES/FC screens,
but can be easily modified for other inputs. Included here are two
different shadowmasks (inline and trinitron) and two scanline fields.
The original description is preserved below for reading.

This scene shows three simple PC-CRT, LCD and TV-CRT subpixel setups.
The default workspace has cameras set up - try rendering them individually.

The TV-CRT example clearly has problems with every second pixel column
being shifted half a row - for this, the source image has to be shifted
accordingly.
